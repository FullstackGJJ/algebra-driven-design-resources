# algebra-driven-design-resources

I was inspired to make this as a resource for gathering helpful tools and explanations for describing an interesting way to write software. By utilizing concepts coming from a combination of abstract algebra and lambda calculus, I believe it is possible to construct abstractions and data types that can lead to software that is easy to maintain, easy to modify, and easy for new talent to reason about. 

# Useful background context

This youtube [video](https://youtu.be/xAFawAKjLfA) was great to get things going. It introduces concepts of abstract algebra and the presenter's application to writing animation library in Swift.

This [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLi01XoE8jYoi3SgnnGorR_XOW3IcK-TP6) is an awesome introduction for beginners who are not familiar with abstract algebra to get familiar with concepts such as groups, rings, and isomorphism.

This [textbook](https://www.amazon.com/Applied-Abstract-Algebra-Undergraduate-Mathematics-ebook-dp-B000YIYN9C/dp/B000YIYN9C/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=1609381590) goes into examples of applied abstract algebra, most importantly abstract data types and their implications on software design.

This [ebook](https://algebradriven.design/) which was the first material I read regarding the subject but found it too difficult as an introduction into the subject. All the earlier listed material were very helpful in helping me connect the dots for this book.

# Step by step

I think a good place to start is to imagine that you intend to write a library for a specific purpose or domain. You want to first identify a data type in there and establish a rule.
